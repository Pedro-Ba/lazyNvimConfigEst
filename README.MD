These are all my setup files for my neovim config. 

There aren't too many plugins but even then I feel like not everything here is "essential" and there's definitely some fluff (like lualine?) but it still feels fairly minimalistic to me

Mostly can't stay without telescope and the lspconfig/mason setup.
